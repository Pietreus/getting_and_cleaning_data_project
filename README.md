# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the assignment for the Getting and Cleanging Data Course on Coursera.
 
The repository includes following files:
* 'UCI HAR Dataset': folder containing the unchanged Dataset for the assignment 
* 'run_analysis.R': The script that performs the analysis on the dataset
* 'CodeBook.md': Shows information about the variables in the dataset created by run_analysis.R

Notes:
* The R script requires the dplyr package for the analysis
* The dataset folder needs to be in the working directory for the script to function.
* When the script is sourced in R, the 'transformedTbl' variable contains the tidy dataset,  
	the unrefined data can be found in the 'fullTbl' variable.
